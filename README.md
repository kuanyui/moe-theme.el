## Download
### Via package.el
`Moe-theme` is available in [MELPA](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa) repository now, so you can install `moe-theme` easily with `M-x` `list-packages`.

### Manually
Download the archive of `moe-theme` (or `git clone` it) to `~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el` and extract it. Then, add these to your init file:

```lisp
	;;customize theme
	(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el/")
    (require 'moe-theme)
```

## Customizations
It's impossible to satisfy everyone with one fixed theme, but `moe-theme` provide some easy ways to customize itself.

There's a full customization example:

```lisp
    ;; If you want to use powerline, (require 'powerline) must be
    ;; before (require 'moe-theme).
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/powerline/")
    (require 'powerline)

    ;; Moe-theme
    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")
    (require 'moe-theme)

    ;; Show highlighted buffer-id as decoration. (Default: nil)
    (setq moe-theme-highlight-buffer-id t)
    
    ;; Resize titles (optional).
    (setq moe-theme-resize-markdown-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.0 1.0))
    (setq moe-theme-resize-org-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0))
    (setq moe-theme-resize-rst-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0))

    ;; Choose a color for mode-line.(Default: blue)
    (moe-theme-set-color 'cyan)

    ;; Finally, apply moe-theme now.
    ;; Choose what you like, (moe-light) or (moe-dark)
    (moe-light)
```

If you have any question about settings, go on and read following README to get more detailed information first.

>#### Note
>**Notice that the file `moe-theme.el` is NOT a theme file, but it provide the ability for customization `moe-dark-theme` & `moe-light-theme`.**
>
>So, if you just want to use `load-theme` to apply **ONLY** `moe-theme` itself and **without customizations**, you can skip "Customizations" chapter and just use this:
>
>```lisp
>    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")
> 
>    (load-theme 'moe-dark t)
>    ;;or
>    (load-theme 'moe-light t)
>```

### Resize Titles
You may want to resize titles in `markdown-mode`, `org-mode`, or `ReStructuredText-mode`:

```lisp
  ;; Resize titles
  (setq moe-theme-resize-markdown-title '(2.0 1.7 1.5 1.3 1.0 1.0))
  (setq moe-theme-resize-org-title '(2.2 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0))
  (setq moe-theme-resize-rst-title '(2.0 1.7 1.5 1.3 1.1 1.0))
```

>Markdown should have 6 items; org has 9 items; rst has 6 items.
>
>Make sure that these resizing settings should be placed **before** `(moe-dark)` or `(moe-light)`.

The values should be lists. Larger the values, larger the fonts.
If you don't like this, just leave them nil, and all the titles will be the same size.

### Colorful Mode-line and Powerline
Tired of boring blue mode-line? You can set default mode-line color. moe-theme provides 9 colors mode-line style. Add following lines **after** `(moe-light)` or `(moe-dark)`:

```lisp
  (moe-theme-set-color 'orange)
  ;; (Available colors: blue, orange, green ,magenta, yellow, purple, red, cyan, w/b.)
```

You can also use `M-x` `moe-theme-select-color` to change color interactively.

Mayby you'll like `M-x` `moe-theme-random-color`, too; which gives you a random mood :D.

#### Powerline
Now `moe-theme` supports [Powerline](https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline), which makes mode-line looks fabulous! We recommended installing `powerline` and run `powerline-moe-theme`.

>Make sure that `(require 'powerline)` must be placed **before** `(require 'moe-theme)`. Otherwise, `powerline-moe-theme` will not be initallized.

You can add this line to your init file:

```lisp
(powerline-moe-theme)
```

### Too Yellow Background?
With 256-colors terminal, default yellow background of moe-light may be too yellow and harsh to eyes on some screens.

If you encounter this problem, and want to set background color to `#ffffff` in terminal, set the value of `moe-light-pure-white-background-in-terminal` to t. Add this line **before** `(moe-light)` or `(moe-dark)`:

```lisp
    (setq moe-light-pure-white-background-in-terminal t)
```
### Highlight Buffer-id on Mode-line?
You may be dislike default highlight on mode-line-buffer-id, now it can be disable by setting the value of `moe-theme-highlight-buffer-id` to nil. Add this line **before** `(moe-light)` or `(moe-dark)`:

```lisp
(setq moe-theme-highlight-buffer-id nil)
```

## Have A Good Mood Today?
I prefer a terminal with a black-on-white color scheme. I found that in the daytime, sunlight is strong and black-on-white is more readable; However, white-on-black would be less harsh to the eyes at night.

So if you like, you can add the following line to your `~/.emacs` to automatically switch between `moe-dark` and `moe-light` according to the system time:

```lisp
	(require 'moe-theme-switcher)
```

By adding the line above, your Emacs will have a light theme in the day and a dark one at night. =w=+

### Live in Antarctica?
Daytime is longer in summer but shorter in winter; or you live in a high latitude region which midnight-sun or polar-night may occur such as Finland or Antarctica?

There's a variable `moe-theme-switch-by-sunrise-and-sunset` would solve your problem (default value is `t`)

If this value is `nil`, `moe-theme-switcher` will switch theme at fixed time (06:00 and 18:00).

If this value is `t` and both `calendar-latitude` and `calendar-longitude` are set properly, the switching will be triggered at the sunrise and sunset time of the local calendar.

Take "Keelung, Taiwan" (25N,121E) for example, you can set like this:

```lisp
	(setq calendar-latitude +25)
	(setq calendar-longitude +121)
```

## Notes
### No 256-Color Output?
If your terminal emulator doesn't render 256-color output correctly, set its environment variable `TERM` to `xterm-256color`. For example:

- If you are using `bash` or `zsh`, add following line into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

	export TERM=xterm-256color

- Or if you are using `Console`, navigate to `Edit Current Profile > General > Environment > Edit` and add the following line:

    TERM=xterm-256color

- If you're using `tmux` and it cannot display in 256-color correctly, add this to `~/.tmux.conf`, too:

    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

### Paren
If you use Emacs build-in `show-paren-mode`, I recommend set the value of `show-paren-style` to `expression` for optimized visual experience:

```lisp
    (show-paren-mode t)
    (setq show-paren-style 'expression)
```

### Not supported the mode(s) you're using?
Can't bear a mode with an ugly looking? `moe-theme` doesn't support the mode you like? It's welcome to report wishlist or issue on github, I'll try to add related settings as soon as possible. Or of course, you can push request, too. We need your feedback!

## Known Issues
* If you add `(moe-dark)` or `(moe-light)` to your init file, the color of `buffer-id` would be incorrect after startuping CLI Emacs(but if you `M-x moe-dark/light` again, it would be corrected immediately). I don't know why, but this issue doesn't occur in GUI version Emacs. (Tested on GNU Emacs 24.3.90.1 2014-04-11)
* When using `moe-light` and typing characters under terminal emulator (e.g. Konsole) with IM (e.g. fcitx), the string embedded in Emacs may be very insignificant (But as you output the word from IM, it turns normal).

## Todo
* Minor mode for `moe-theme-switcher`.
