#+BEGIN_QUOTE
** Acknowedgement
Latest version is under inactive development. I haven't finished it indeed, however, I personally have already used it for quite a long time.

Currently free time is precious for me, to rest from work, to learn foreign languages, to study Harmony & Voice Leading, to compose, to practice piano and violin, to exercise. So I will not spend more massive time on this project for any large modification. I've ever spent too much time on this project before to hold more passion and patience to write merely a color theme, even not an application. (You will not believe how much it is if you has never done such tedious task for EACH mode and find a color balances manually for them) I think it's enough now.

*If you want to try or help to QA the latest development version, see ~dev~ branch.*

*If you want to make `moe-theme` supports more modes, please send a PR (but be aesthetic; patch with too ugly color balance will be rejected.^^||| )*. Currently I honestly has no more free time and passion on such a tedious time-costing trial-and-error task.

The last but not the least, thanks for your using and happy hacking!

** Requirements

** Download

*** Via package.el

=Moe-theme= is available in [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][MELPA]] repository now, so you can install =moe-theme= easily with =M-x= =list-packages=.

*** Manually

Download the archive of =moe-theme= (or =git clone= it) to =~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el= and extract it. Then, add these to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        ;;customize theme
        (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el/")
        (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/moe-theme.el/")
        (require 'moe-theme)
#+END_SRC

** Customizations

It's impossible to satisfy everyone with one fixed theme, but
=moe-theme= provide some easy ways to customize itself.

There's a full customization example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        ;; If you want to use powerline, (require 'powerline) must be
        ;; before (require 'moe-theme).
        (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/powerline/")
        (require 'powerline)

        ;; Moe-theme
        (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")
        (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")
        (require 'moe-theme)

        ;; Show highlighted buffer-id as decoration. (Default: nil)
        (setq moe-theme-highlight-buffer-id t)

        ;; Resize titles (optional).
        (setq moe-theme-resize-markdown-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.0 1.0))
        (setq moe-theme-resize-org-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0))
        (setq moe-theme-resize-rst-title '(1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0))

        ;; Choose a color for mode-line.(Default: blue)
        (moe-theme-set-color 'cyan)

        ;; Finally, apply moe-theme now.
        ;; Choose what you like, (moe-light) or (moe-dark)
        (moe-light)
#+END_SRC

If you have any question about settings, go on and read following README
to get more detailed information first.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  **** Note

  *Notice that the file =moe-theme.el= is NOT a theme file, but it
  provide the ability for customization =moe-dark-theme= &
  =moe-light-theme=.*

  So, if you just want to use =load-theme= to apply *ONLY* =moe-theme=
  itself and *without customizations*, you can skip "Customizations"
  chapter and just use this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
         (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/PATH/TO/moe-theme/")

         (load-theme 'moe-dark t)
         ;;or
         (load-theme 'moe-light t)
  #+END_SRC
#+END_QUOTE

*** Resize Titles
You may want to resize titles in =markdown-mode=, =org-mode=, or
=ReStructuredText-mode=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      ;; Resize titles
      (setq moe-theme-resize-markdown-title '(2.0 1.7 1.5 1.3 1.0 1.0))
      (setq moe-theme-resize-org-title '(2.2 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0))
      (setq moe-theme-resize-rst-title '(2.0 1.7 1.5 1.3 1.1 1.0))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Markdown should have 6 items; org has 9 items; rst has 6 items.

  Make sure that these resizing settings should be placed *before*
  =(moe-dark)= or =(moe-light)=.
#+END_QUOTE

The values should be lists. Larger the values, larger the fonts. If you
don't like this, just leave them nil, and all the titles will be the
same size.

*** Change Color of Mode-line (or Powerline)

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
 (moe-theme-set-color 'orange)
 ;; (Available colors: blue, orange, green ,magenta, yellow, purple, red, cyan, w/b.)
#+END_SRC

You can also use =M-x= =moe-theme-select-color= to change color interactively.

Or =M-x= =moe-theme-random-color= to have a good luck.

**** Powerline support

Now =moe-theme= supports [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][Powerline]]. Run =powerline-moe-theme= if =powerline= installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (powerline-moe-theme)
#+END_SRC

** Frenquently Asked Problems
*** No 256-Color Output?

If your terminal emulator doesn't render 256-color output correctly, set its environment variable =TERM= to =xterm-256color=. For example:

- If you are using =bash= or =zsh=, add following line into your =~/.bashrc= or =~/.zshrc=:

  : export TERM=xterm-256color

- Or if you are using =Konsole=, navigate to =Edit Current Profile General > Environment > Edit= and add the following line:

  : TERM=xterm-256color

- If you're using =tmux= and it cannot display in 256-color correctly, add this to =~/.tmux.conf=, too:

  : set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

*** Parenthesis Is Hard To Read?

I recommend set the value of =show-paren-style= to =expression= for better visual experience:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        (show-paren-mode t)
        (setq show-paren-style 'expression)
#+END_SRC

** Known Issues
- If you add =(moe-dark)= or =(moe-light)= to your init file, the color
  of =buffer-id= would be incorrect after startuping CLI Emacs(but if
  you =M-x moe-dark/light= again, it would be corrected immediately). I
  don't know why, but this issue doesn't occur in GUI version Emacs.
  (Tested on GNU Emacs 24.3.90.1 2014-04-11)
- When using =moe-light= and typing characters under terminal emulator
  (e.g. Konsole) with IM (e.g. fcitx), the string embedded in Emacs may
  be very insignificant (But as you output the word from IM, it turns
  normal).
